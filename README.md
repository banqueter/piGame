This is a game built fully in Javascript. 

It is a two players game where the opponents are trying to reach the number 100 by rolling a dice and taking turns.
Summing-up their score they will have the ability to choose if they want to hold and pass or keep rolling. 
Every time they roll a 1 the score for the current turn will be set to zero.

Kudos to Jonas Schmedtmann
