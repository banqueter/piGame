This is a game built fully in Javascript. 

It is a two players game where the opponents are trying to reach the number 100 by rolling a dice and taking turns.
By summing up their score they will have the ability to choose if they want to hold the score and pass or keep rolling. 
Every time they roll a 1 their score is set back to zero.
